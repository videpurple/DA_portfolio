# ðŸ”„ Funnel Analysis for User Signup Optimization

This project analyzes the user signup flow of a service platform to identify drop-off points and improve conversion rates.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Understand user behavior through event logs
- Calculate conversion rates at each stage of the signup process
- Compare device and country-level conversion performance
- Propose data-driven improvements to increase signup completion

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies

- PostgreSQL
- Power BI
- Mode Analytics Dataset: [User Engagement Tutorial](https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/a-drop-in-user-engagement)

## ðŸ§ª Key Steps

1. Queried raw event log data using PostgreSQL
2. Measured conversion between steps: create_user â†’ enter_email â†’ enter_info â†’ complete_signup
3. Visualized funnel breakdown by device and country in Power BI
4. Identified segments with high dropout rates and suggested improvement points

## ðŸ’¡ Key Insights

- Conversion rates were significantly lower on tablets and in certain countries (e.g., Turkey, Austria)
- Notebooks and PCs showed slightly higher completion rates
- Recommended UI testing and localization support for low-converting devices/regions
