# 🧩 Customer Segmentation Using RFM Analysis and Clustering

This project segments retail customers based on their purchase behavior to support targeted marketing strategies.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Classify customers based on recency, frequency, and monetary value (RFM)
- Apply clustering techniques to identify customer groups
- Provide marketing recommendations tailored to each segment

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- Python (Google Colab)
- Pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib
- Dacon Dataset: [Customer Segmentation Challenge](https://dacon.io/competitions/official/236222/data)

## 🧪 Key Steps

1. Cleaned and joined transaction, customer, and discount datasets
2. Calculated RFM scores using quantiles and standardized values
3. Applied KMeans clustering to group customers
4. Visualized and profiled clusters to derive actionable insights

## 💡 Key Insights

- Cluster 1 (Loyal): High spenders with frequent, recent purchases  
- Cluster 0 (Lost): Low activity, long inactivity — re-engagement needed  
- Proposed targeted campaigns for “Potential” and “Enthusiast” segments
