# 1Ô∏è‚É£ Project Objective

## 1. Business Context (Assumed)

H Company is a UK-based online select shop that launched in December 2018. They offer a wide variety of products including gifts and household items. With one year of transaction data available, the company seeks to assess how well customers are retained over time and identify ways to improve long-term engagement.

## 2. Analytical Goal

This project aims to simulate a real-world analysis scenario using open-source data from Kaggle.

The goal is to analyze customer retention trends using cohort and range-based analysis, and to derive data-driven strategies for user re-engagement and lifecycle management.

## 3. Methodology

Retention was analyzed using two key methods:

- **Cohort Analysis**: Users were grouped into cohorts based on shared characteristics, primarily by signup or first purchase date, to analyze behavioral trends over time.
- **Retention Charting**: Retention rates for each cohort were visualized to identify patterns in user activity and drop-off across time periods.

# 2Ô∏è‚É£ Key Findings

## 1. Purchase Interval

<aside>
üîñ The **median purchase interval** for our users is **57 days**.

</aside>

‚úîÔ∏è The analysis targeted users who made at least one repeat purchase after their first order, representing approximately **66%** of total users.

‚úîÔ∏è The purchase interval was calculated as:
`Last Purchase Date - First Purchase Date / (Number of Purchases - 1)`

![Number of Customers by Purchase Interval Group.png](Number_of_Customers_by_Purchase_Interval_Group.png)

![Customer Distribution by Purchase Interval.png](Customer_Distribution_by_Purchase_Interval.png)

- More than half of repeat customers made their next purchase within **1 to 60 days**.
- While the **average interval** was 78.4 days, the distribution showed high variability due to the wide range of product types offered.
- Therefore, the **median** was used as a more stable retention benchmark, as it is less affected by extreme outliers.
- SQL Query - Purchase Cycle Distribution
    
    ```sql
    WITH cycle AS (
    	SELECT ROUND(DATEDIFF(last_order_date, first_order_date) / (cnt_orders - 1), 0) AS purchase_cycle 
    		 , CustomerId
    	FROM customer_stats
    	WHERE cnt_orders >= 2
    	GROUP BY purchase_cycle, CustomerId HAVING purchase_cycle > 0
    	ORDER BY purchase_cycle
    )
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN purchase_cycle BETWEEN 1 AND 60 THEN CustomerId END) AS '1~60'
    	   , COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN purchase_cycle BETWEEN 61 AND 120 THEN CustomerId END) AS '61~120'
         , COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN purchase_cycle BETWEEN 121 AND 180 THEN CustomerId END) AS '121~180'
         , COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN purchase_cycle BETWEEN 181 AND 240 THEN CustomerId END) AS '181~240'
         , COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN purchase_cycle BETWEEN 241 AND 300 THEN CustomerId END) AS '241~300'
         , COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN purchase_cycle BETWEEN 301 AND 360 THEN CustomerId END) AS '301~360'
         , COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN purchase_cycle > 360 THEN CustomerId END) AS '360~'
    FROM cycle;
    
    -- Note: The average and median purchase intervals were calculated separately using Google Sheets for better visualization.
    ```
    

## 2. **Retention Analysis**

> To better understand customer engagement over time, we applied **range-based retention analysis** using 60-day (2-month) intervals, based on the median purchase interval of 57 days.
Each ‚ÄúMonth 0‚Äù represents the number of users who made their **first purchase** in that particular month.
> 

<aside>
üîñ Compared to December 2018, the number of new customers in January 2019 dropped sharply. By November 2019, this figure had declined by approximately **72%** from the baseline.

The **lowest new user count** occurred in August 2019, followed by a **63% increase** in September‚Äîlikely due to the back-to-school season.

<aside>
üîñ The **average retention rate at Month 2** was **33.8%**, which is relatively high compared to industry benchmarks (typically below 20% after 8 weeks[¬π](https://www.notion.so/E-commerce-Customer-Retention-Analysis-1f5aa5dfec478105b447ec2506ba0d24?pvs=21)[**‚Åæ**](https://www.notion.so/E-commerce-Customer-Retention-Analysis-1f5aa5dfec478105b447ec2506ba0d24?pvs=21)).
Although Month 2 exhibited the **lowest average retention rate**, a **gradual upward trend** was observed in later months, with some temporary drops and stabilizations in between.
‚Üí It is essential to investigate strategies to improve Month 2 retention, as it represents a key drop-off point despite relatively strong early engagement.

# 3Ô∏è‚É£ Recommendations

Based on the retention analysis and customer behavior patterns, we propose the following action plans to address key challenges:

---

### Challenge 1: Decreasing number of new customers

![Monthly First-Time Customer Count.png](Monthly_First-Time_Customer_Count.png)

**‚úÖ Action Plan 1 ‚Äì Launch a Referral Program**

Introduce a referral system where existing users can invite friends. If a referred friend makes a purchase, both users can choose between a reward (e.g., free shipping or bonus points).

This approach not only encourages new signups but also drives first purchases, increasing the pool of potential repeat customers.

**‚úÖ Action Plan 2 ‚Äì First Purchase Incentives**

Offer exclusive perks such as gift wrapping or a discount for first-time buyers. Promote these benefits through marketing campaigns to attract more first-purchase users.

---

### **Challenge 2: Low retention within the first two months after initial purchase**

**‚úÖ Action Plan ‚Äì Personalized Push Notifications**

Send push notifications before the 2-month mark to users who haven't made a second purchase. Include personalized product suggestions based on previous browsing behavior and offer surprise discount coupons to re-engage them.

---

### **Challenge 3: Extremely low purchasing activity in August**

**‚úÖ Action Plan ‚Äì Back-to-School and Summer Campaign**

Since August coincides with the UK summer holiday period, run seasonal promotions on vacation items, summer goods, and family activity kits (e.g., baking or crafts) to stimulate purchases.

---

### **Challenge 4: Long-term retention slope flattens too early**

**‚úÖ Action Plan ‚Äì Calendar-Based Gifting Reminders**

Allow users to sync their calendars. For those who opt in, send gift reminders and recommendations ahead of birthdays and anniversaries of friends and family.

Even without calendar sync, suggest gifts for widely celebrated events (e.g., New Year‚Äôs Day, Mother‚Äôs Day, Father‚Äôs Day) to maintain engagement and repeat visits.

# 5Ô∏è‚É£ Reflection

**‚úÖ Liked**

When I first learned retention analysis, I found the cohort charts somewhat confusing. However, by working through this project step by step, I gained a much clearer understanding and was able to deepen my knowledge of the methodology.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Lacked**

The dataset did not include product category information, which made it impossible to calculate purchase intervals by category. This limited the scope of behavioral segmentation.

**üìö Learned**

Beyond the technical understanding of retention metrics, this project reinforced the importance of clearly defining the objective before beginning any analysis.

**üéØ Longed for**

I would like to build the ability to compare different retention types (e.g., bounded, classic, rolling) and determine which approach is most appropriate based on the business context.
