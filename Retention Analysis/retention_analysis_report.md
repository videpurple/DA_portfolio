# E-commerce Customer Retention Analysis (Full Report)

## 1. 🏢 Business Context (Simulated)
H Company is a UK-based online select shop that launched in December 2018. The platform sells a wide range of products, including gift items and practical home goods. This project simulates a real-world business scenario using open-source data from Kaggle, covering one year of transaction data to examine customer retention and uncover engagement trends.

## 2. 🎯 Analytical Goal
The objective of this analysis is to understand customer retention trends using cohort and range-based retention analysis. Based on observed patterns, this report also proposes data-driven strategies to improve customer re-engagement and long-term value.

       MAX(Date) AS last_order_date,
       COUNT(DISTINCT OrderId) AS cnt_orders,
       ROUND(SUM(Price * Quantity), 2) AS sum_sales
FROM records
GROUP BY CustomerId;
```

## 4. ⚙️ Methodology
### Cohort Grouping
Customers were grouped by their **first purchase month** to evaluate retention trends over time.

### Range-Based Retention
To reflect the long purchase cycle of the service, retention was measured in **60-day intervals**, using the **median purchase cycle of 57 days** as a reference point.

## 5. 📈 Analysis Results
### Purchase Cycle
- Median purchase interval: **57 days**  
- Average purchase interval: **78.4 days**  
- Over **52.9%** of customers had a purchase cycle of 1–60 days

```sql
-- SQL: Purchase Cycle Grouping
WITH cycle AS (
  SELECT ROUND(DATEDIFF(last_order_date, first_order_date) / (cnt_orders - 1), 0) AS purchase_cycle,
         CustomerId
  FROM customer_stats
  WHERE cnt_orders >= 2
  GROUP BY purchase_cycle, CustomerId
  HAVING purchase_cycle > 0
)
SELECT
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN purchase_cycle BETWEEN 1 AND 60 THEN CustomerId END) AS '1–60',
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN purchase_cycle BETWEEN 61 AND 120 THEN CustomerId END) AS '61–120',
  ...
FROM cycle;
```

### Retention Trends
- Month 2 retention: **33.8%**, above industry benchmark (~20%)
- August cohort retention drops significantly at Month 8

## 6. 💡 Recommendations
### Challenge 1: Low new user acquisition
**→ Launch a referral program**  
Reward both the referrer and the invitee when the latter completes their first purchase.

### Challenge 2: Early churn within 2 months
**→ Trigger personalized push notifications**  
Send discount alerts or recommended items before Month 2 if no second purchase has occurred.

### Challenge 3: Low activity in August
**→ Run summer promotions**  
Capitalize on UK summer holidays with themed discounts and family-oriented products.

### Challenge 4: Flat long-term retention
**→ Use calendar-based reminders**  
Send alerts for birthdays and holidays to prompt gift purchases.
